\title{transform the list of time series retrieved with getSDMX in a merged data.frame}
\description{
  This function is used to transform the output of the getSDMX (or getTimeseries) 
  functions from a list of time series to a data.frame. The metadata can be requested by explicitly passing the
  'meta' parameter.
}
\usage{
  sdmxdf(tslist, meta=F)
}
\arguments{
  \item{tslist}{the list of time series to be converted}
  \item{meta}{set this to TRUE if you want metadata to be included (this may increase the size of the result quite a bit)}
}
\examples{
# not run
# a=getSDMX('ECB', 'EXR.A|Q|M|D.USD.EUR.SP00.A')
# ddf = sdmxdf(a)
}
